# Goal #

The goal of this project is to
  * develop an implementation of C in [Jetbrains MPS](http://jetbrains.com/mps)
  * generate C code that runs on Lejos Osek and then
  * demonstrate the power of domain-specific adaptation of C to make the development for embedded systems in general, and C/Osek/Mindstorms development specifically, simpler.
